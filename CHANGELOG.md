# CHANGELOG

## [1.1]

2022-05-20

- Resolved missing code that prevented the `PreferJamf` managed preference key from being respected.
- The `--prefer-jamf` option will now result in an exit error if run from a computer with no Jamf binary.

## [1.1b2]

2022-05-16

- When used with Jamf Pro 10.38 or later, all MDM software update commands now use the Jamf Pro API (as opposed to the Classic API).
- When used with Jamf Pro 10.38 or later, system updates via MDM now forces a restart by killing any apps that don't quit when requested.
- More reliable logging when downloading and preparing updates via MDM.
- The `--verbose-mode` option now shows the percentage complete when downloading and preparing updates via MDM.
- The `--policy-triggers` option now detects when Jamf Pro Policies complete with success or failure. If all Jamf Pro Policies completed, then the `--policy-triggers` option is automatically cleared.
- Various code syntax changes per [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) recommendations.

## [1.1b1]

2022-05-10

- The super workflow now automatically installs all available non-restart required "recommended" Apple software updates on both Intel and Apple Silicon computers prior to downloading any restart required system updates. Thus, all non-restart required updates are installed before the user is prompted to restart.
- Jamf Pro inventory is now updated immediately after non-restart required "recommended" Apple software updates are automatically installed.
- The current user is now checked immediately before any prompts in case super has been running for a while (due to earlier installations or downloads).
- Re-built softwareupdate checking functions to improve reliability, logging, and allow for future improvements.
- The `--policy-triggers` option no longer requires the `--force-restart` option to take advantage of dialogs, notifications, deferrals, and deadline workflows. This allows Jamf Pro Policies to control when the computer restarts.
- The `--policy-triggers` option now requires a local Jamf binary.
- The `--force-restart` option no longer requires a local Jamf binary. Now using `shutdown -o -r +1` instead.
- The `--open-logs` option now works with older versions of macOS. However, detailed MDM and `softwareupdate` logs are still only available for macOS 11 or later.
- Startup workflow now kills any previous IBM Notifier instance.
- Jamf Pro Policies now called via `-event` instead of legacy `-trigger` ([#5](https://github.com/Macjutsu/super/pull/5), thanks to @kenchan0130).
- Resolved text encoding issue causing "?" to appear in notifications and dialogs ([#6](https://github.com/Macjutsu/super/pull/6), thanks to @kenchan0130).

 - Ability to prefer `jamfHelper` over [IBM Notifier](https://github.com/IBM/mac-ibm-notifications) via `--prefer-jamf | --no-prefer-jamf` options and managed preference: `<key>PreferJamf</key> <true/> | <false/>`
 - Deferral times all normalized to between 120 seconds and 86400 seconds (1 day).
